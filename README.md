# python-ipc

Contained within this repository is a series of tests which I conducted against
the Python implementations for interprocesscommunication and/or data sharing.

The goal is to test out the following:

- IPC between two independent processes using sockets

## Terminology

- **Independent Processes**: Processes launched independently from one another.
  For an example, open a shell, start a process. Then open another shell and
  start a different process.
